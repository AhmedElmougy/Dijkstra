# Dijkstra 
 dijkstra shortest path algorith implementation

 The folder contains C++ implementation for Dijkstra shortest path algorithm for searching a tree as well as graph and vertex ADT implementation
 To represent a graph, I used adjacency list representation using vector of vectors of vertex 
 Graph class have methods for manipulating a graph such as: 
 multiple class constructor for appropriately initialize the graph you can specify number of vertices in graph and density of edges and graph will be initialized with random edge values
 add vertex, add edge, and delete edge 
 Dijkstra class can be used to find the shortest path between any source vertex and every other vertices and output a path from source vertex to each vertex in the graph
 outputted vertex is represented as follows (previous vertex - vertex final value -> next vertex)
